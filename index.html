<p>BTS was formed in 2010 by the Big Hit Entertainment company, which held auditions to create a hip hop boy band. The final lineup was completed in 2012, after several changes and selections. Before debuting, the members of BTS already attracted attention for their social media posts, song covers, and mixtapes. </p>

<p>BTS' official debut was on June 12, 2013, with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, which included the song "No More Dream." This album was the first in his “school trilogy” series, which reflected the problems and dreams of young people.
